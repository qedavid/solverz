# solverz

AI-assisted attacks on open math problems; every result is checked in Lean 4.

## Problem

What we want to solve. `/solve <problem>` runs the core skill `solve` with
the modules its README lists.

A module is a skill whose folder also holds a `template/`: the skill adds its
files, their relations and steps to `solve`'s loop; setup copies its
`template/` next to the problem template (`template/`).

Modules:

- `find`: questions answered by an object (Instances, objects).

## Where things live

```
.claude/               skills and agents
template/              what every new problem is set up from (Files)
problems/              the problem lists and one folder per problem (Files)
toolbox/               techniques to draw on; toolbox/check.ps1 validates it
principles.md          how we think and work
.worktrees/<problem>/  the git worktree each problem is solved in (Rules)
```

## Files

Every problem has these (`template/`); each module it lists adds more (its skill's `template/`), described in its skill.
In a template, `<…>` in the text and `{…}` in file and folder names are placeholders to replace; an example row with nothing to fill is deleted.

| File               | What it holds, how it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `README.md`        | For visitors first: the question and its status (as in the root README's Problems table), its Solutions with how to check them; then the problem in plain terms and the goal with its Lean name; the literature, with dated searches, including those that found nothing; last, for the work: the link to `state.md`, its kind, the modules it uses, the estimate and optional constraints (files not to edit, compute limits).                                                                                                                                                  |
| `state.md`         | Now: the focus, the next step, what is running (agents and experiments: what, when started, where its output goes) and what needs the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `understanding.md` | What holds (heuristics marked as such), what blocks every approach so far, and so what a Solution must do; each point cites its evidence by ID. Rewritten when the understanding changes; single failures stay in the files of what they tested.                                                                                                                         |
| `ideas/` | A way to attack the problem. Technique (its toolbox entry and name, e.g. `T301` generalize; `—` and a name when the toolbox has none), source (ideator, literature, us), the claims it needs, including the claim that those claims imply the goal. Status: `new` → `alive` (survived its kill test) \| `dead` (which claim failed) \| `solved`. |
| `claims/` | One precise statement. The claims it uses; evidence; what was tried and failed. Status: `open` → `refuted` (counterexample) \| `proved` → `verified` (Lean). `approved` when the user confirmed its Lean statement says what we mean. |
| `lean/`            | The problem's Lean library: `<Problem>.lean` imports its modules; `<Problem>/Statement.lean` holds the goal and the definitions it uses; `<Problem>/Tests/` unit-tests the statements; `<Problem>/<Author>/`, if any, holds Lean imported from that author, with its license and notice; everything else is ours.                                                        |
| `solver/`          | The problem's Rust crate: `README.md` lists its engines and what each was checked against; `src/` holds the engines; `src/bin/` holds its binaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `experiments/` | Its Experiments (`E1`…): computations whose outcome is used as evidence. What one tests and decides is stated before it runs, on committed code validated first (it reproduces known values or objects and rejects broken ones, or agrees with an independent computation). Any other computation is exploration in `scratch/`. |
| `reviews/` | Its Reviews (`R1`…): the refuter's reports a status rests on. Target (IDs), verdict, date, what was attacked, findings, literature; its scripts in `R<n>/`. The researcher records a report from `scratch/` as a Review once a status changes or is confirmed by it; whatever cites the refuter cites its Review. |
| `scratch/`         | Git-ignored playground; nothing there counts. Exploring there is always allowed; the rules apply to what gets recorded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `journal.md`       | Steps that changed a status, newest first; one timestamped line each, under its date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `solutions.md`     | Its Solutions (`Z1`…), newest first: Lean-checked statements that solve published open questions (one or many table entries, a record, a conjecture). One is listed once the refuter SURVIVES it, its origin credits whoever had it first, and the user approves it. Until then it waits under "Needs the user" in `state.md`; `solutions.md` gets it only on approval. |
| `papers/` | Our own papers (`P1`…), one folder each: `main.tex` (long ones split into `sections/`), `refs.bib`, `numbers.py` (every number from the data at the paper's baseline tag, so a rebuild never drifts) and `latexmkrc`, which builds into the git-ignored `build/`; `_papers.md` lists them: title, kind (paper, note), what it presents, its baseline, status `draft` → `checked` (the refuter: each statement matches its Lean theorem, each number its file) → `approved` (the user), its versions, and which version was shared where. Approval commits the PDF as `P<n>-v<k>.pdf`, never overwritten, and tags that commit `<problem>/P<n>-v<k>`; a change after approval returns it to `draft` and becomes the next version. |

### Relations

- An idea needs claims, a claim uses claims (both many to many).
- A refuted claim kills every idea that needs it and reopens every proved
  claim whose proof uses it.
- An experiment found wrong reopens every claim it refuted, and every idea
  those claims killed.
- An idea whose claims are all verified solves the problem.
- A Review found wrong reopens every status it confirmed.
- A paper presents only approved entries (Solutions, and a module's, like
  corrections); a Solution's `Shared` names the paper that carries it.

## Roles

| Role       | Who             | Started by                  | Job                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Researcher | main session    | `/solve <problem>`          | Runs `solve`'s loop. It knows what the problem's files hold, builds the understanding of the problem, decides from it what is most promising and works it itself; it never hands its line off or waits. It keeps `understanding.md` current: rewritten when its understanding changes; single failures stay in the files of what they tested. |
| Ideator    | agent `ideator` | the researcher              | Brings fresh angles; its ideas are proposals. Optional, never a step anything waits on; a round takes 30–90 min.                                                                                                    |
| Refuter    | agent `refuter` | the researcher              | Tries to break something before its status changes (a proof, a computation's outcome, a Lean statement, …). SURVIVES: the new status stands. REFUTED: it is wrong; its opposite is recorded. FLAWED: the old status stays, the flaw is recorded. UNCLEAR: settling it is the next step. Its report is recorded as a Review (`reviews/`).                     |

## Rules

### Agents and experiments

- They run in the background while work goes on; each is listed under
  Running in `state.md` until its result is recorded.
- At most 3 agents at a time, each with `model: opus` (always the newest Opus).
- Experiments may use whatever RAM, CPU and GPU is free, keeping about 4 GB
  RAM and 2 threads spare so the system doesn't swap or lag; one GPU job at a
  time. An experiment that can't fit on this machine is not run.

### Statements

- Never edit an approved statement; a change is a new statement.

### Worktrees

- Each problem is solved in its own worktree `.worktrees/<problem>/` on the
  long-lived branch `solve/<problem>`.
- It is made once and reused by every session of that problem.
- One commit per step.
- Only the researcher works in a worktree; everything else (choose,
  maintain, …) works in the main folder, on main.

### Trust

- Nothing counts as verified or as a Solution until Lean checks it: `lake build --wfail`, no `sorry`,
  no custom `axiom`, no `native_decide`; `#print axioms` shows only
  `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.
- Solvers and agents are untrusted.
- Read any downloaded Lean file before compiling it.

### Lean

- Lean and Mathlib are pinned to v4.35.0 (`lean-toolchain`, `lakefile.toml`).
- Import every module in its library root once it is `sorry`-free;
  `lake build` only checks what the roots import. Check an unfinished
  module with `lake build <Module>`.
- `lake env lean` skips the lakefile's `leanOptions` (e.g. `autoImplicit = false`).
- After any Mathlib change, the user runs `lake exe cache get` before
  anything builds, or Mathlib compiles from source (hours).

### The user decides

Each of these goes under "Needs the user" in `state.md`; mention it, and keep
working on what doesn't depend on it.

- Approving statements.
- Calling anything a Solution.
- Sharing outside the repo.
- Bumping Lean or Mathlib.
- Merging into main.
- Pushes.
- Installs and downloads.

## Conventions

- **Names:** problem folders kebab-case (`catch-up`); its Lean library the
  same words in UpperCamelCase (`CatchUp`); its solver crate keeps the
  folder name.
- **IDs:** an entity's letter and a number (`C1`, `N1`, `Z1`, …); stable,
  never reused.
- **Lean:** one file per topic, UpperCamelCase (`CatchUp/Parity.lean`).
  Names follow
  [Mathlib's conventions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html):
  theorems snake_case, value-computing definitions lowerCamelCase, types and
  `Prop` definitions UpperCamelCase, all in the problem's namespace. Each
  file has a `/-! … -/` module doc-string after its imports.
- **Rust:** [API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html)
  naming.
- **Dates:** ISO 8601 (`2026-10-29`).
- **Commits:** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
  `type(scope): summary`, a body with what and why. Scope: the problem
  folder or the repo area. One logical change per commit.

## This machine

The machine's resources and tool paths (CPU, GPU, RAM, disks, where Lean, Rust and
TeX Live live) are in the user's own CLAUDE.md (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, This machine),
outside the repo.
